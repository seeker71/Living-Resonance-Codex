## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Core Architecture Components**
1. **`CentralizedNodeStorage`**: Singleton storage manager with comprehensive indexing
2. **`SharedNodeSystem`**: Base class providing unified node operations
3. **`GenericNode`**: Universal data structure with rich ontological metadata
4. **Component Wrappers**: Each layer wrapped with node-based interface

### **Storage Features**
- **Multi-Index Support**: By type, water state, fractal layer, chakra, relationships
- **Component Tracking**: Monitors component access and creation
- **Health Metrics**: Storage health and performance monitoring
- **Relationship Management**: Full parent-child relationship support

### **Migration Pattern Applied**
```python
# Before: Isolated storage
class OldSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}  # Isolated per instance

# After: Centralized storage  
class NewSystem(SharedNodeSystem):
    def __init__(self, component_name):
        super().__init__(component_name)  # Connects to centralized storage
```
