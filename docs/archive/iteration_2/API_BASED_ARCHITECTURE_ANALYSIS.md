# API-Based Knowledge System Architecture Analysis
## Long-Term vs Short-Term Memory Management

This document analyzes the new API-based architecture that uses the federated API for knowledge exploration while implementing efficient memory management through long-term and short-term memory systems.

## üåü Architecture Overview

The new system separates concerns between:
- **Federated API**: Handles knowledge exploration, curiosity questions, and system evolution
- **Memory Management**: Efficiently stores and retrieves knowledge exchanges
- **Knowledge Explorer**: Orchestrates API calls and memory operations

## üß† Memory Architecture

### Short-Term Memory (Question-Answer Exchanges)

**Purpose**: Store individual knowledge exchanges for immediate access and analysis

**Structure**:
```sql
short_term_memory (
    exchange_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    entities_involved TEXT NOT NULL,
    resonance_score REAL NOT NULL,
    energy_exchange REAL NOT NULL,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    context TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

**What it stores**:
- Individual question-answer pairs
- Resonance scores from API exploration
- Energy exchange information
- Full context from API responses
- Entity involvement tracking

**Characteristics**:
- **High detail**: Complete context and responses
- **Fast access**: Direct lookup by exchange ID
- **Temporary**: Eventually compressed into long-term memory
- **Rich metadata**: Full exploration context

### Long-Term Memory (Structural Evolution Summaries)

**Purpose**: Store compressed summaries that capture how the system structure evolves over time

**Structure**:
```sql
long_term_memory (
    summary_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    exchange_ids TEXT NOT NULL,
    key_concepts TEXT NOT NULL,
    structural_changes TEXT NOT NULL,
    evolution_patterns TEXT NOT NULL,
    energy_signature TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    updated_at TEXT NOT NULL
)
```

**What it stores**:
- **Exchange IDs**: References to related short-term exchanges
- **Key Concepts**: Core concepts explored in the exchanges
- **Structural Changes**: How resonance and energy patterns evolved
- **Evolution Patterns**: Temporal and conceptual evolution insights
- **Energy Signatures**: Compressed energy and resonance data

**Characteristics**:
- **Compressed**: Multiple exchanges summarized into one record
- **Structural**: Focuses on how things change, not individual details
- **Persistent**: Long-term storage of evolution patterns
- **Indexed**: Fast concept-based retrieval

### Memory Index (Concept-Based Access)

**Purpose**: Enable fast searching across both memory types by concept

**Structure**:
```sql
memory_index (
    concept TEXT NOT NULL,
    summary_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    relevance_score REAL NOT NULL,
    last_accessed TEXT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (concept, summary_id)
)
```

**What it enables**:
- Fast concept-based searches
- Relevance scoring for results
- Access pattern tracking
- Efficient memory retrieval

## üéØ Memory Efficiency Strategy

### Compression Principles

1. **Store Only What's Essential**:
   - Short-term: Full context for immediate use
   - Long-term: Only structural evolution patterns
   - Index: Only concept mappings and relevance scores

2. **Automatic Summarization**:
   - Triggered when short-term memory reaches threshold
   - Groups related exchanges by concept similarity
   - Extracts only structural and evolutionary insights

3. **Context Preservation**:
   - Short-term exchanges maintain full API context
   - Long-term summaries reference original exchanges
   - Full context can be reconstructed if needed

### Storage Optimization

**Short-Term Memory**:
- Stores complete exploration context
- Includes full API responses
- Maintains entity relationships
- Tracks energy and resonance details

**Long-Term Memory**:
- Compresses multiple exchanges into summaries
- Focuses on structural changes
- Tracks evolution patterns
- Maintains concept relationships

**Memory Index**:
- Enables fast concept-based searches
- Tracks relevance and access patterns
- Minimal storage overhead
- Fast retrieval performance

## üöÄ API Integration Architecture

2. Check Short-Term Memory (Cache)
   ‚Üì
3. If Not Found: Call Federated API
   ‚Üì
4. Create Knowledge Exchange
   ‚Üì
5. Store in Short-Term Memory

```

### API Endpoints Used

- **`POST /curiosity/questions`**: Create new exploration questions
- **`POST /curiosity/explore/{id}`**: Explore specific questions
- **`GET /system/overview`**: Get system context and state

### Error Handling

- **API Failures**: Graceful fallback to cached results
- **Memory Errors**: Continue operation with reduced functionality
- **Network Issues**: Retry with exponential backoff

## üîç Memory Search and Retrieval

### Search Strategy

   - Long-term: Structural, evolutionary insights
   - Combined: Comprehensive knowledge view

3. **Relevance Scoring**:
   - Concept match strength
   - Temporal recency
   - Resonance and energy relevance
   - Access pattern frequency

### Result Types
