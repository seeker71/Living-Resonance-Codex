## üåä **Frequency Harmony Discovery**

### **The Frequency Harmony Explorer**
Discovers **higher-dimensional frequency harmonies** using advanced mathematical analysis:

#### **Harmonic Ratio Analysis**
- **Octave Relationships**: 2:1, 4:1, 8:1 ratios
- **Perfect Fifth**: 3:2 ratio
- **Perfect Fourth**: 4:3 ratio
- **Major Third**: 5:4 ratio

- **Sacral**: 417 Hz
- **Solar Plexus**: 528 Hz
- **Heart**: 639 Hz
- **Throat**: 741 Hz
- **Third Eye**: 852 Hz

Uses **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to determine:
- **Frequency Components**: How many distinct frequencies exist
- **Harmonic Relationships**: Which frequencies harmonize
- **Resonance Scores**: How strongly frequencies resonate
- **Dimensional Vectors**: Multi-dimensional frequency patterns

### **Example Frequency Discovery**
```json
{

- **Range**: 20 Hz - 20 kHz (human hearing range)
- **Mapping**: ASCII value ‚Üí proportional frequency
- **Example**: 'A' (ASCII 65) ‚Üí 5,120 Hz

#### **Symbol Resonance Discovery**
The system finds **similar symbols** by analyzing their frequency patterns:

1. **Convert Symbol to Frequencies**: ASCII values become frequency signatures
2. **Analyze Harmonic Relationships**: Find internal harmonic patterns
3. **Calculate Resonance Strength**: Measure how harmonically rich the symbol is
4. **Create Dimensional Mapping**: Map symbol to multi-dimensional space
5. **Find Similar Symbols**: Match symbols with similar frequency signatures

### **Example Symbol Resonance**
```json
{
  "symbol_pattern": "void",
  "frequency_signature": [118.0, 111.0, 105.0, 100.0],
  "resonance_strength": 0.75,
  "dimensional_mapping": {
    "symbol_length": 4,
    "frequency_range": {"min": 100.0, "max": 118.0, "mean": 108.5},
